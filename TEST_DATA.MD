# 📊 Seneca Book Store - Streamlined Test Data & System Guide

This document provides comprehensive information about the enhanced test data system, application access, sample credentials, API routes, and system capabilities for the Seneca Book Store project.

## 🚀 Enhanced Data Loading System

### 📋 Intelligent Data Loading Features
- **Smart Stock Management**: Realistic order generation with proper stock tracking and depletion simulation
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checking before data loading with timeout handling
- **Robust Error Handling**: Retry logic with realistic constraints and comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Proper user session handling with cart persistence and authentication validation
- **Environment Awareness**: Automatic SSL handling for Kubernetes deployment
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates and detailed logging with performance metrics
- **Shopping Cart Integration**: Test data includes cart scenarios and user session management

### 🛠️ Streamlined Scripts (Optimized & Clean)
- **Primary Loader**: `scripts/load_test_data.py` - Enhanced comprehensive data loader with smart retry logic
- **Data Generator**: `scripts/generate_test_data.py` - Intelligent test data generation with stock management
- **Quick Setup**: `scripts/quick_start_data.sh` - Minimal setup script for development

### 📊 Enhanced Loading Process
1. **Service Health Check**: Waits up to 5 minutes for all services to be ready with exponential backoff
2. **User Management**: Creates admin and regular users with proper authentication tokens and session validation
3. **Book Catalog**: Loads 200 books with complete metadata, realistic pricing, and stock levels
4. **Smart Order Generation**: Creates ~120 realistic orders with proper stock tracking and availability checks
5. **Shopping Cart Setup**: Initializes empty carts for new user sessions with proper state management
6. **Data Verification**: Comprehensive validation and result tracking saved to `test_data/loading_results.json`

### 🎯 Realistic Data Distribution
- **Users**: 50 total (5 admin, 45 regular users) with diverse profiles
- **Books**: 200 books across multiple categories (Programming, Fiction, Business, etc.)
- **Orders**: ~120 orders with realistic distribution (60% completed, balanced buy/rent ratio)
- **Stock Management**: Intelligent stock depletion simulation with availability tracking
- **Cart System**: Empty carts on deployment, persistent during user sessions, cleared on logout
