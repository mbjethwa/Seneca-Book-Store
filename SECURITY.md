**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready | **Last Audit**: August 7, 2025

## Overview

The Seneca Book Store is built with security as a core principle. This document outlines our comprehensive security measures, audit results, and best practices.

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin and user roles with appropriate permissions
- **Secret Key Management**: Cryptographically secure SECRET_KEY generation
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout on deployment with version tracking

### Infrastructure Security
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Least-privilege access control for all services
- **Network Policies**: Zero-trust networking with explicit allow rules
- **TLS/HTTPS**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive configuration
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Application Security

SECRET_KEY=<generated-secure-key>  # Use: openssl rand -base64 32
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=<secure-database-url>

# Service URLs (production should use HTTPS)
USER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com
CATALOG_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com
ORDER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Monitoring

2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration**
3. **Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days minimum)**
4. **Enable audit logging in production**
5. **Use HTTPS in production environments**
6. **Regularly update dependencies**
7. **Monitor security metrics and logs**

## Development Security

### Test Credentials
- Use the `scripts/generate_secure_credentials.py` script to create secure test credentials
- Never use hardcoded passwords in test scripts
- Test credentials should be generated randomly and stored securely

### Code Security
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- Authentication tokens are validated on every request
- Error messages don't expose internal system details

## Deployment Security

### Kubernetes Security
```yaml
# Example secure pod configuration
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 2000
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### Network Security
- All services communicate over encrypted connections
- Network policies restrict inter-service communication
- External access is controlled through ingress rules
- Database access is restricted to authorized services only

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
Regular dependency scanning is performed to identify and address vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip-audit

# Node.js dependencies
npm audit

# Container scanning
docker scan
```

### Security Updates
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security patches are applied promptly
- All updates are tested in staging before production deployment
