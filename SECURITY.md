# Security Policy

## Overview

The Seneca Book Store is built with security as a core principle. This document outlines our security measures, best practices, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt with salt for secure password storage
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin and user roles with appropriate permissions
- **Secret Key Management**: Cryptographically secure SECRET_KEY generation

### Infrastructure Security
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Least-privilege access control for all services
- **Network Policies**: Zero-trust networking with explicit allow rules
- **TLS/HTTPS**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive configuration
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and Content Security Policy
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin resource sharing

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all user actions
- **Security Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for security monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring and alerting

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# JWT Configuration
SECRET_KEY=<generated-secure-key>  # Use: openssl rand -base64 32
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=<secure-database-url>

# Service URLs (production should use HTTPS)
USER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com
CATALOG_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com
ORDER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Monitoring
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-password>
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration**
3. **Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days minimum)**
4. **Enable audit logging in production**
5. **Use HTTPS in production environments**
6. **Regularly update dependencies**
7. **Monitor security metrics and logs**

## Development Security

### Test Credentials
- Use the `scripts/generate_secure_credentials.py` script to create secure test credentials
- Never use hardcoded passwords in test scripts
- Test credentials should be generated randomly and stored securely

### Code Security
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- Authentication tokens are validated on every request
- Error messages don't expose internal system details

## Deployment Security

### Kubernetes Security
```yaml
# Example secure pod configuration
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 2000
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### Network Security
- All services communicate over encrypted connections
- Network policies restrict inter-service communication
- External access is controlled through ingress rules
- Database access is restricted to authorized services only

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
Regular dependency scanning is performed to identify and address vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip-audit

# Node.js dependencies
npm audit

# Container scanning
docker scan
```

### Security Updates
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security patches are applied promptly
- All updates are tested in staging before production deployment

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- **Email**: security@senecabooks.com
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Immediate impact assessment and classification
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause of the incident
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- User data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Personal information is processed in accordance with privacy laws
- Data retention policies are implemented and enforced
- User consent is obtained for data collection and processing

### Security Standards
- Follows OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Implements secure coding practices
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Security training for all development team members

## Security Metrics

Key security metrics monitored:
- Authentication failure rates
- Token expiration and refresh patterns
- Failed authorization attempts
- Service health and availability
- Resource utilization and anomalies
